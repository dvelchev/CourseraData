## The Data Set

The [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) contains data collected from the recordings of 30 volunteers performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.  
The data consists of the sampled and pre-processed signals of the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, labeled with the activity that the subject was carrying on while the signal was captured and randomly split into a training and test sets.  
The dataset is available for download at this [location](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

correct activity  Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
